environment
  food


creature
  int foodEaten
  Position position

  Gene[GENOME_SIZE] genome
  Brain brain

Gene
  neuron* input
  int weight
  neuron* output

Position
 int x
 int y

enum Direction
  north (pos y)
  east (pos x)
  south (neg y)
  west (neg x)

Brain
  neuron ptr array afferent

do we need a special interface for neurons generally or just neuron-inputtable ones?

SensoryNeuron (Afferent Neuron)
  axon axon
  something about its sensory input?

Interneuron
  input can be Afferent or another central

MotorNeuron (Efferent Neuron)
  output has some effect (move, etc)
  input from afferent or central
  
Axon
  float weight
  neuron* target





when applying stimulus to a brain, we need it to efficiently
apply only environmental parameters for which the brain has 
sensory neurons. How to do this?
things like chemical gradients need only be computed for points
where creatures exist. we don't need some massive array of data
representing environmental state in every position (though we do
need some sort of "map" which can describe locations of food, obstacles, etc)

some sort of enum mapping to an environmental param to the neuron type?

when an output neuron fires, the organism tries to interact with the environment
should the environment process these actions? environment needs to be re-entrant

for the simplest case, the environment isn't an entity, and is just static info including
min/max x
min/max y
food location(s)

do some environment class
 - creatures belong to environment (reference)




projects
------
simulation (no graphics)
graphical sim (run with simulation)
... visualizing data after the fact

minimum start: make a creature which just has position, might move randomly
maybe environment

genes/neural net comes later
